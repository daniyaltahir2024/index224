<h1> Quick Tutorial </h1>
    <h2> The OpenAI API provides a simple interface for developers to create an intelligence layer in their applications, powered by OpenAI's state of the art models. The Chat Completions endpoint powers ChatGPT and provides a simple way to take text as input and use a model like GPT-4 to generate an output.</h1>

        <h3> This quickstart is designed to help get your local development environment setup and send your first API request. If you are an experienced developer or want to just dive into using the OpenAI API, the API reference of GPT guide are a great place to start. Throughout this quickstart, you will learn:

          How to setup your development environment
          How to install the latest SDKs
          Some of the basic concepts of the OpenAI API
          How to send your first API request
          If you run into any challenges or have questions getting started, please join our developer forum.
          
          Account setup
          First, create an OpenAI account or sign in. Next, navigate to the API key page and "Create new secret key", optionally naming the key. Make sure to save this somewhere safe and do not share it with anyone.
          
          Quickstart language selection
          Select the tool or language you want to get started using the OpenAI API with.
          
          Python is a popular programming language that is commonly used for data applications, web development, and many other programming tasks due to its ease of use. OpenAI provides a custom Python library which makes working with the OpenAI API in Python simple and efficient.
          
          Step 1: Setup Python
          Install Python
          Setup a virtual environment (optional)
          Install the OpenAI Python library
          Step 2: Setup your API key
          Setup your API key for all projects (recommended)
          Setup your API key for a single project
          Step 3: Sending your first API request
          Making an API request
          After you have Python configured and an API key setup, the final step is to send a request to the OpenAI API using the Python library. To do this, create a file named openai-test.py using th terminal or an IDE.
